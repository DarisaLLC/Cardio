Example of Use:
cardiomyocyte_3 (-1, dL, L, W, 0.0002, Cs)
â€¨where dL = cell contraction (cm), L = original cell length (cm), W = cell width (cm) and Cs = shear wave velocity of gel (cm/s) = 100 * sqrt(E/1.24) , where E is the Young's modulus in kPA. 
The calculated contractile force is shown under "Total reaction force exerted by gel"
